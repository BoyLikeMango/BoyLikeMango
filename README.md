Hi there!👋
My netname is 'BoyLikeMango芒果仔'.
Glad to meet you!😃

Basic Self-Introducing:
  I'm a 13-year-old student in an ordinary secondary school in Jiangsu Province in China🤗
  I like eating mangoes and programming best.
  I believe we will definitely become friends!🥰
  Please provide more guidance to me.Thanks a lot!🫶


😕 Why I choose this name? Isn't this name grammatically incorrect?

  Of course that's true.
  I became a user of "shequ.codemao.cn" in October,2020.
  On the sofa of my dad's office,I came up with this name(The name is "MangoBoy芒果仔"at first) on 13 Dec,2020.
  In the winter holiday of 2021,I found a webpage with a website address of "mangoboy.com".
  I was so surprised that I immediately changed my name into "BoyLikeMango芒果仔".
  At that time,I didn't find the mistake.
  3 months later,I found it,but the name can only have 15 characters.
  My name is so long,but I didn't have any other ideas left.
  So,that's my last choice😅

OK,that's all.Thanks for reading🙏
